  paragraphs: "**A dedicated brand designer, Stew is at his most content when presenting.
    He is driven by the marrying of bold ideas with beautifully made creative.**\n\nStewart's
    enemy is pedestrian branding. It is his firm belief that every brand can amuse,
    entertain and surprise their audience. The best projects walk a fine line between
    graphic restraint and impactful messaging. \n\nYou'll find Stew straddling that
    line."

    Initially we assisted with the SMR 2016 Review, created merchandise and designed exhibition materials. We were exceptionally proud of our work on the annual review but recognised that there was much to be done to develop the charity’s brand identity and communications.

    To really get under the skin of the organisation we discussed SMRs challenges with members of their executive and ran a brand workshop for their members at an SMR general meeting in Stirling.

    In 2017 the organisation were in the process of updating their base signage, had held a joint parliamentary reception at Holyrood and were in the process of hiring a development officer.

    Next we gained a better understanding of SMR activities, its member teams and the people who volunteer with them. We visited the charity’s office in Aviemore, took a tour of member MRT bases, visited Ochils MRT as they supported a community event and joined Aberdeen MRT on their annual sponsored walk.

    Conducting a brand audit flagged up technical issues with the SMR logo and highlighted the need for an expanded toolkit for SMRs graphic identity.

    MRT volunteers regularly put their lives on hold to save the lives of others. It surprised us to find that the majority of those we spoke to did not think of themselves as extraordinary or heroic.

    Whilst we disagree with them, we embraced the ‘power of the ordinary’ as an opportunity to highlight some of the more reasonable unreasonable things that they voluntarily do.

    Variations on SMR’s logo appear on their volunteers clothing, teams vehicle livery, supporters kit, fundraising materials and merchandise across Scotland.

    Their logo has good brand recognition and heritage. Graphically it predated the organisation's name (which changed from the Mountain Rescue Committee of Scotland in 2014). Instead of reinventing the wheel at great expense the logo was redrawn to improve legibility and assist with production. This gives more control on type sizes, reproduces better in print and assists with manufacturing and fabrication requirements.

    used by the national organisation along with notes on their colour values and
    typefaces. SMR also own registered trade marks on various marketing messages.
    For the first time this information was all recored in one resource.

  paragraphs: We created a newspaper version of the review specifically for members
    of both UK and Scottish parliaments. This allows elected representatives to consume
    information at a glance and the tabloid format hoped to encourage more engagement
    with SMR. The document accompanied a parliamentary reception at Holyrood.

    Our brand materials have improved massively as a result of Don’t Walk’s involvement. They have been easy to work with, keen to understand our organisation, the community of independent teams and the challenges we face with branding.

    I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Don’t Walk. I am very impressed with their commitment, flexibility, willingness to overdeliver and straight forward communication.

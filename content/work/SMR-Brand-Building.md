      SMR is a representative and coordinating body for member Mountain Rescue
      Teams (MRTs) in Scotland. Their membership includes more than 850
      volunteers between 23 member MRTs. In addition SMR also serves three
      Police Scotland MRTs and one RAF MRT.


      MRT members are always on call; any day, any hour, any weather.


      Don’t Walk have been providing graphic design services and consultancy to
      Scottish Mountain Rescue since 2017.

      Initially we assisted with the SMR 2016 Review, created merchandise and
      designed exhibition materials. We were exceptionally proud of our work on
      the annual review but recognised that there was much to be done to develop
      the charity’s brand identity and communications.


      To really get under the skin of the organisation we discussed SMRs
      challenges with members of their executive and ran a brand workshop for
      their members at an SMR general meeting in Stirling.


      In 2017 the organisation were in the process of updating their base
      signage, had held a joint parliamentary reception at Holyrood and were in
      the process of hiring a development officer.

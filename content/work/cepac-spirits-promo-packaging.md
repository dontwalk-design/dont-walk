    Cepac are the UK’s leading independent corrugated packaging company.

    Over the last 20 years they have taken pride in their pioneering spirit in state-of-the-art corrugate packaging. Like ourselves, Cepac believe collaboration is key to delivering results.

    We were commissioned to create a sample pack targeting UK design agencies promoting quality packaging for the spirits industry.

    [Arcwise](http://arcwise.se/)®, developed by Swedish firm SCA, is new technology which allows corrugate cardboard to be formed in to rounded shapes without sacrificing quality or structural integrity.

    Cepac promoted Arcwise alongside a presentation on the future of corrugate at the Spirits Packaging Summit 2018. This promotional mailer served as an introduction of Cepac and Arcwise to UK design agencies and as an invite to the event itself.

    We collaborated with illustrator [Ben O’Brien](http://Ben%20the%20Illustrator%20https://bentheillustrator.com/), an industry veteran, to create illustrations of spirits bottles overlaid on curved shapes. Ben’s style lent itself well to corrugate print processes and we were confident in his ability to deliver on brief, on time and on budget.

    A number of recipients posted images of the pack on social media.

    Within two weeks of receiving the pack, one of the targeted prospects had contacted Cepac to discuss a live project.

    From day one of this project we truly partnered with both the client and our suggested collaborators.

    Working with Cepac’s in house team was vital in creating the product design and print of the mailer sample itself. Ben was in touch with Cepac from the very start of the project, which ensured his illustrations required very few amendments. SCA were more than happy to support our (no doubt difficult) requests for content and technical knowledge.

    We were happy to attend the Spirits Packaging Summit 2018 with Cepac and were excited and intrigued to witness the future possibilities for curved corrugated.

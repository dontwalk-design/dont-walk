    <p>SMR is a representative and coordinating body for member Mountain Rescue Teams (MRTs) in Scotland. Their membership includes more than 850 volunteers between 23 member MRTs. In addition SMR also serves three Police Scotland MRTs and one RAF MRT.<p>
    <p>MRT members are always on call; any day, any hour, any weather.</p>

  <h2 class="ttu f3 f1-ns lh-solid">A route map to branding</h2>
  <h3 class="ttu f4 f2-ns lh-solid">First steps</h3>

  <div class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure-wide">
    <p>Initially we assisted with the SMR 2016 Review, created merchandise and designed exhibition materials. We were exceptionally proud of our work on the annual review but recognised that there was much to be done to develop the charity’s brand identity and communications.</p>
    <p>To really get under the skin of the organisation we discussed SMRs challenges with members of their executive and ran a brand workshop for their members at an SMR general meeting in Stirling.</p>
    <p>In 2017 the organisation were in the process of updating their base signage, had held a joint parliamentary reception at Holyrood and were in the process of hiring a development officer.</p>

  <div class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure-wide">
    <p>Next we gained a better understanding of SMR activities, its member teams and the people who volunteer with them. We visited the charity’s office in Aviemore, took a tour of member MRT bases, visited Ochils MRT as they supported a community event and joined Aberdeen MRT on their annual sponsored walk.</p>
    <p>Conducting a brand audit flagged up technical issues with the SMR logo and highlighted the need for an expanded toolkit for SMRs graphic identity.</p>

  <h2 class="ttu f3 f1-ns lh-solid">Icons and illustration</h2>

  <div class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure-wide">
    <p>Whilst the logo was under development we created a suite of icons, illustrations and marketing messages for the organisation. Creating a cohesive set of pictorial assets begun to tie SMRs marketing materials together.</p>

    <p>MRT volunteers regularly put their lives on hold to save the lives of others. It surprised us to find that the majority of those we spoke to did not think of themselves as extraordinary or heroic.</p>
    <p>Whilst we disagree with them, we embraced the ‘power of the ordinary’ as an opportunity to highlight some of the more reasonable unreasonable things that they do.

  <div class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure-wide">
    <p>SMR’s logo appears on their volunteer uniforms, teams vehicle livery, supporters kit, fundaising materials and merchandise across Scotland.</p>
    <p>The logo has good brand recognition and heritage. Graphically it predated the organisations name (which changed from the Mountain Rescue Committee of Scotland in 20XX). Instead of reinventing the wheel at great expense the logo was redrawn to improve legibilty. This gives more control on type sizes, reprodices better in print and assists with manufacturing and fabrication requirements.</p>

  <div class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure-wide">
    <p>We created a set of brand guides detailing the various logos and badges used by the national organisation along with notes on their colour values and typefaces. SMR also own registered trade marks on various marketing messages. For the first time this infomration was all recored in one resource.</p>
    <p>David Crozier, a Bristol based architect, was commisioned to transform the SMR logo in to manufacturing spec signage.</p>

  <h2 class="ttu f3 f1-ns lh-solid">Parliamentary recognition</h2>

  <div class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure-wide">
    <p>We created a newspaper version of the review specifically for members of both UK and Scottish parliaments. This allows ministers to consume information at a glance and the tabloid format hoped to encourage more engagement with SMR. The document accompanied a parliamentary reception at Holyrood in 2017.</p>

    <p>Each member team has a rich heritage and strong identity of its own. To maintain overall brand consistency while allowing them to speak to their local audience, the 2017 SMR Review also allowed for personalised versions, for any team requiring it.</p>

    Ramblers Scotland works to secure access, develop paths, protect the natural beauty of the countryside and promote walking for everyone. 

    As part of the Ramblers Association since 1935 it's fair to say that Ramblers Scotland have a fair history to report on.

    Don't Walk helped to create their first ever professionally designed annual report for members (2017–18).

    This project faced a relatively short turnaround time including a hard deadline in the form of the Ramblers Scotland's AGM. As time was of the essence we quickly moved to establish where we could make the most graphic impact with the least disruption to draft content edits.

    It was hugely beneficial to work within a predefined brand guide and build upon existing visual assets to give the report its own flavour.

    Alongside typesetting written content we created a set of illustrations to accompany facts on each page of the report.

    created a distinctive document and lifted the content in a way it had never been
    presented to members before.

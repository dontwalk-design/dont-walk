That was exactly what we needed online at the time. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nWhen circumstances dictate that we need more from our site, we add more. The first addition was a list of what we were currently working on. Once we had some content on our social channels, we added links to them from our site. More recently, we added a \"work\" section to publish case studies and then, once we had some thoughts/opinions written down, we added a blog section too. This article lives within the blog."

paragraphs = "It's very easy to get hung up on websites. Chasing future-proof perfection tends to result in websites which take many months to launch or which never launch at all. Nobody wants that frustration in their life. Relax, your website will never be finished and that's ok. \n\nIt's perfectly fine to launch one page at a time, a new section next month, some updated graphics in 6 months time, new functionality when it's needed. The time to do each part of this is when those actual requirements actually need to be met. Focus on what you need today and make that \"iteration 1\". When you've delivered that, you'll know what to do next. \n\nThe important thing is to have a website online which meets the needs of your business right now. It's out there, doing it's job and delivering value efficiently and with minimum fuss. We believe that's the sign of a good website and that kind of site deserves a launch partyâ€¦even though we're not having one."

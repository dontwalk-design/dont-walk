Something else happened and we decided to set up a design agency. We didn’t do it in a pub because everyone does that these days. Don’t Walk seemed like an appropriate name at the time."

Despite applying for a business bank account on March 20th we found ourselves waiting a month for a paper application pack to arrive at our accountants.\n\nNext up we found ourselves stuck in an infinite loop with their twitter ‘bot’ (I am adamant it wasn’t a human). Then they asked us for a cheque to prove our identity. By May the 9th we were beyond keen to invoice our clients. The bank offered us thirty pounds in compensation but we didn’t have an account to put it in."

By this point we had met with another bank, Barclays in Aberdeen. We spoke to a human on the phone and in person. They even offered advice on our business plan. It was lovely.\n\nOn May 22nd, about a week after meeting with Barclays, we had an account with them. To celebrate, we invoiced our clients.\n\nDon’t Walk were in business."

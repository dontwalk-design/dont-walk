paragraphs = "### He knows his shit, and he’s still a nice chap.\n\n### Who?\n\nA senior designer with a real eye for craft. We won’t say much here, because words don’t do his visuals justice. Paul’s a sole trader who’s output could match many a studio.\n\n### Where?\n\nPaul is based in Aberdeen, UK. He can be found mountain biking, walking the dog or buried under a mountain of paper samples.\n\n### What?\n\nDesigner, animator, pixel pusher and all round perfectionist. Paul thrives on clear strategic briefs where he can lead creative.\n\nWe have collaborated together on projects for our clients; Waterloo Replayed, Scottish Mountain Rescue, Engine Shed and Aberdeen MRT.\n\n### Why?\n\nDesigners with Paul’s pedigree are a rare find. He’s fast, accurate and always exceeds the brief. Paul Mullen is a steady pair of hands and those hands craft some incredible work.\n\n### How\n\nPaul isn’t really that hard to find. We can put you in touch with him or you can follow him on the usual channels. Don’t be surprised if he already knows who you are.\n\nInstagram: [PaulFMullen](https://www.instagram.com/paulfmullen/)\n\nLinkedIn: [Paul Mullen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-mullen-12b3a748/)\n\nHis website: [paulmullen.co.uk](http://www.paulmullen.co.uk/)\n\n> _“Mark and Stew have been friends and colleagues for years.

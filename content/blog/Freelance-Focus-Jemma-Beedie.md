paragraphs = "### Who?\n\nA lifelong writer with more than a few tricks up her sleeve. Jemma finds the joy in content creation and natural-sounding SEO. She’s written about everything from shellfish to ponchos and swears she’s loved every minute of it.\n\n### Where?\n\nAfter a childhood in Bahrain and a few years wandering the globe — we love her book about living the #vanlife — Jemma has settled into a cottage in the Trossachs. So twee it makes us sick.\n\n### What?\n\nWriter of all types, editor, proofreader extraordinaire. She’s been a journalist, she’s been an academic: if there’s research to be done, she’s your woman. Good with words and how to use them.\n\nWe’ve worked with Jemma on projects including Scottish Mountain Rescue and our own in-house blogs. She’s a good all-rounder to have on the team.\n\n### Why?\n\nDo you know the difference between a colon and a semicolon? Where should you use an em dash? If you need which or that?\n\nJemma does. She revels in the persnickety. When nobody else has the time or inclination to fix spelling, grammar and syntax, she’s there with patience and expertise. Seriously. We’ve caught her red-penning posters in the pub.\n\n### How?\n\nWe can put you in touch with Jemma or you can follow her on the usual channels. Ask her to tell you the one about the panda, the sandwich and the pistol.\n\nTwitter: [Jemmasaid](https://twitter.com/jemmasaid)\n\nLinkedIn: [Jemma Beedie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jemma-beedie-75b08039/)\n\nWebsite: [jemmabeedie.com](https://jemmabeedie.com/)\n\n_“I like things to be interesting or need a little creative problem-solving. Luckily Stew and Mark meet both requirements.”_\n\n_— Jemma Beedie_\n\nIf you want to work with us, or have a project you need a hand with, just drop me a message: stewart@dont-walk.com"

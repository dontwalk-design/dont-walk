      <h1>A creative partnership specialising in design.</h1>
      <p>We are designers, developers and strategists but mostly, we're people just like you. In the past, we've worked together and apart for business large and small.</p>
      <p>Since August 2016 we've been doing our own thing. What we've learned is we prefer working together than apart.</p>
